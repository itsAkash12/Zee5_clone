I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJs, ES6.

Let us share my experience,<br>
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. there were some more functionalities that could have been done, the time didn’t permit me to go further.
